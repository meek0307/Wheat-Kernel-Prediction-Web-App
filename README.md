# Wheat Kernel Predictor

Wheat kernel Predictor is a web app which has a Machine Learning model running at the back. The purpose of developing this app is to predict the class of the seed based on the various parameters.the dataset has being taken from the uci repository which has following parameters: 
Area,Perimeter, Compactness, Length of kernel, Width of kernel, Asymmetry coefficient, Length of kernel groove.
