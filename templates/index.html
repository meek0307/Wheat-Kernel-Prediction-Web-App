          <h2>India <br><span>A Farming Land</span></h2>
          <p> "It is true that agriculture is the backbone of nation's economy.Wheat is one of the most important staple food grains of human race. India produces about 70 million tones of wheat per year or about 12 per cent of world production. Being the second largest populous country, it is also the second largest in wheat consumption after China, with a steep growing wheat demand.</p>

      <h2>About Wheat kernel Prediction Web App</h2>
      <p class="about-content" style="text-align: center;color: black;">Wheat kernel Predictor is a web app which has 
      a Machine Learning model running at the back. The purpose of developing this app is to 
      predict the class of the seed based on the various parameters.the dataset has being taken from 
      the uci repository which has following parameters: Area
      Perimeter, Compactness, Length of kernel, Width of kernel, Asymmetry coefficient, Length of kernel groove.
      
      The codes for this project can be checked in my <a href="https://github.com/meek0307/Wheat-Kernel-Prediction-Web-App" style="color: black; font-weight: bold;">github repo</a>.

      The problem of not being able to identify the right wheat seed kernel is a significant challenge faced by farmers in India. The selection of high-quality seeds is crucial for achieving good yields and maintaining crop productivity.
      However, the identification of the right seed kernel is not always easy, particularly for small-scale farmers who may not have access to advanced technology and scientific methods.
      Using the wrong seed kernel can result in poor yields, low-quality produce, and lower market value, leading to financial losses for farmers. Furthermore, planting low-quality seed can increase the risk of diseases and pests,
      leading to higher input costs in terms of fertilizers, pesticides, and labor.The problem of identifying the right seed kernel is often compounded by the lack of access to quality seeds, which can result in farmers using whatever seed is available to them, regardless of quality. Additionally, the lack of awareness about the importance of seed selection and the limited availability of information on identifying the right seed kernel can also contribute to the problem.

      To address this issue, farmers can use this Wheat-Kernel-Prediction-Web-App and thus this web app will contribute to the overall growth and development of the agricultural sector in India.
